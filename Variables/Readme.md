# Ruby variables
Ruby variables are locations which hold data to be used in the programs. Each variable has a different name. These variable names are based on some naming conventions. Unlike other programming languages, there is no need to declare a variable in Ruby. A prefix is needed to indicate it.

## There are four types of variables in Ruby:

  Local variables
  Class variables
  Instance variables
  Global variables
